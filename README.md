# ⚛️ React + Vite Starter Project

A modern starter template for building scalable React applications, powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for lightning-fast development and optimized builds.

This project includes a clean architecture with reusable components, context APIs, custom hooks, utility services, and a basic authentication setup — making it ideal as a solid foundation for new projects.
