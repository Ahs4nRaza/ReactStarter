# React + Vite Starter Project

This is a starter project that sets up a basic foundation for React applications using Vite as the bundler. It includes a clean structure for reusable components, context APIs, custom hooks, and services, as well as a simple authentication setup. This project is meant to serve as a base for building scalable React applications with a modern development setup.
